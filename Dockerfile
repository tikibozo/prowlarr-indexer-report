# Install the app, then remove pip itself. Nothing runs pip at runtime (the
# container starts uvicorn as a non-root user), and pip ships a vendored
# dependency set with its own CycloneDX SBOM at pip/_vendor/bom.cdx.json. Image
# scanners read that SBOM and report CVEs for the vendored copies (msgpack,
# setuptools) even though the app never imports them and they are unreachable in
# a running container. Dropping pip removes the package manager from the runtime
# image, which is worth doing on its own terms — and keeps the Trivy gate honest
# rather than silencing it with an ignore file.
